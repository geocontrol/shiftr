A small project to try and re-create a dopplr type site. Its just an experiment.

Using Ruby On Rails, create a simple system that acts much like dopplr does/did to experiment more with linking up with social networks, getting the graphs from them and displaying the graph information in the site. 

Needs to appreciate privacy, a user should only share their travel information with people they want to know, maybe allow a way of having public travel info as well a private, which is only shared with people they want?

Initially just use the Twitter social graph information, not use facebook.
